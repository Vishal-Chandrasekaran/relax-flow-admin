## Core Frameworks
- **Next.js**: `15.2.4`  
  - Modern React framework for SSR, SSG, and hybrid apps.

- **React DOM**: `^19`

## Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: `^3.4.17`  
  - Utility-first CSS framework.
  - Best Practice: Use with PostCSS and keep config files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`) versioned.
- **Radix UI**: (multiple `@radix-ui/*` packages, v1.x/2.x)
  - Accessible, unstyled UI primitives. Used for dialogs, menus, forms, etc.

- **zod**: `latest`
  - TypeScript-first schema validation.
- **@hookform/resolvers**: `latest`
  - Integrates Zod and other schema validators with react-hook-form.

## Best Practices & Remarks
- Use `latest` only for libraries where breaking changes are rare or easy to fix (e.g., Zod, react-hook-form). For core dependencies, prefer explicit versioning to avoid unexpected breaking changes.
- Regularly run `pnpm update` or `npm update` and review changelogs for major dependencies.
- Keep devDependencies (TypeScript, @types/*, etc.) up to date for best DX and type safety.
- Use [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot) or similar tools to automate dependency updates.
- Review and test after upgrading any major dependency, especially React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
