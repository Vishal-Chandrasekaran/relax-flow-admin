## GraphQl Interaction Rules

- Always import Apollo Client from a [Apollo-Server.ts](mdc:lib/Apollo-Server.ts) instance to avoid multiple clients.
- Use GraphQL Codegen to generate typed hooks to avoid manual query typing.
- Do not define GraphQL queries inline in components. Store them in [Apollo-Queries.ts](mdc:lib/Apollo-Queries.ts)
- Every API call must handle loading, error, and empty states.
- Define Queries and Mutation in store actions.
